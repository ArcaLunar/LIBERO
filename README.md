# VLA Tasks
This repository aim to collect a set of tasks for the VLA (Vision-Language Agent) to learn from. The tasks are designed to be diverse, covering various aspects of vision and language understanding.

## Installation Instructions
We prepare a set of installation instructions to help you set up the environment for running the tasks.
- [Installation Guide for LIBERO on Windows](./docs/install_win.md)
- [Installation Guide for LIBERO on Linux](./docs/install_linux.md)
- [Installation Guide for LIBERO on MacOS](./docs/install_macos.md)

> **Note:** We tried to install LIBERO on WSL and virtual machines, but neither of them worked well.
